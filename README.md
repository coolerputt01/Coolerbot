It's designed to be easily customizable and extendable, making it a great starting point for any chatbot application.

## ‚ú® Features

## üîß Installation

Follow these steps to get CoolerBot up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd cooler-bot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```

    This will start the Vue.js development server, and you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8080` (or the address shown in your terminal).

## üíª Usage

Once the application is running, you can start interacting with the chatbot. The `UserInput` component allows you to type and send messages, which will then appear in the `ChatWindow` component. The `AiMessage` and `UserMessage` components display the respective messages.

Here's a basic overview of the main components:

*   **ChatWindow.vue**: The main chat window that displays messages.
*   **UserInput.vue**: The input field for users to type their messages.
*   **AiMessage.vue**: Displays messages from the AI.
*   **UserMessage.vue**: Displays messages from the user.

Feel free to modify these components and integrate your own AI backend for a fully functional chatbot.
